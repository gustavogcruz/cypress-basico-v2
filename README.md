Projeto de testes baseado no curso Cypress - Básico - v2 de https://github.com/gustavogcruz/cypress-basico-v2

## Pre-requirements
It is required to have Node.js and npm installed to run this project.

I used versions `v16.19.1` and `8.19.3` of Node.js and npm, respectively. I suggest you use the same or later versions.

## Installation
Run `npm install` (or `npm` i for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests
You can run the tests simulating a desktop or mobile viewport.  

## Desktop
Run `npm test` (or `npm t` for the short version) to run the test in headless mode
on a desktop viewport.

Or, run `npm run default` to open Cypress in interactive mode on a desktop viewport.

## Mobile
Run `npm run test:mobile` to run the test in headless mode on a mobile viewport.

Or, run `npm run default:mobile` to open Cypress in interactive mode on a mobile viewport.
